# Introduction:

The increasing availability of air quality data presents an opportunity to apply Big Data Analytics for deeper 
insights and predictive modeling. Traditional methods of air quality analysis often struggle with 
handling large, heterogeneous datasets. However, with advancements in data storage, processing, 
and machine learning techniques, Big Data Analytics provides a robust framework for analyzing 
historical air quality trends and forecasting future pollution levels. 

This study integrates  five diverse datasets from different sources and formats,encompassing 
multiple air quality parameters across various locations. By employing data preprocessing, 
feature engineering, and statistical analysis, we aim to extract 
meaningful patterns and develop predictive models for air pollution forecasting.

# Problem Definition:

The challenge of air quality forecasting lies in integrating diverse datasets from multiple sources, 
each with varying formats, measurement units, and inconsistencies. Traditional methods struggle 
with handling large-scale, heterogeneous data, leading to inefficiencies in processing and 
prediction accuracy. This study addresses these issues by implementing a scalable ETL pipeline 
to extract, transform, and load air quality data, ensuring consistency, completeness, and usability 
for effective forecasting and analysis.
